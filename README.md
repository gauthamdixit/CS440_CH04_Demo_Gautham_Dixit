# CS440_CH04_Demo_Gautham_Dixit

The license I chose was the eclipse publice license 1.0. I chose this license because it allows you to link code under the license to proprietary applications. Also, this license allows for commerical use of the product, so you can sell your products for money, and the license allows for private use. You can also distribute your work and sublicense which allows for you to extend the license or grant licenses. The license does not allow for trademark use and you can not use contributors names/trademark logos.
